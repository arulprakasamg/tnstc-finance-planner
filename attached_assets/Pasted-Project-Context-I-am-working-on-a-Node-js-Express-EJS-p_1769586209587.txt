Project Context:
I am working on a Node.js + Express + EJS project named TNSTC Finance Planner.
The UI, layout, CSS, and EJS structure are finalized.
Do NOT change design, HTML structure, or styling.

🚨 Core Business Rule (VERY IMPORTANT)

For the following modules, ALL monetary values are entered and stored in LAKHS, not rupees:

HSD Management (Outstanding only)

Daily Collections

Payment Planning

Expenses shown in Financial Report

Example:

₹1,00,00,000 (1 Crore) is entered as 100

₹25,00,000 is entered as 25

These values are ALREADY in Lakhs when saved in JSON files.

❌ Current Problem

In the Financial Report, backend logic is incorrectly converting values again, assuming they are rupees:

Extra divisions like /100, /100000, etc.

Double conversion from Lakhs → Rupees → Lakhs

This causes:

HSD Outstanding totals to be wrong

Collection / Expense / Payment totals to mismatch

Financial Report showing empty or incorrect data

✅ Correct Logic (What MUST be implemented)
GLOBAL RULE (Except Bank Balance):

Treat all numeric values as Lakhs

DO NOT convert Lakhs to Rupees

DO NOT divide or multiply by any factor

Directly sum, subtract, and display values

Specifically Fix:
1️⃣ HSD Outstanding (Financial Report)

Use values from HSD Management as-is

Support multiple purchase dates

Display per-date outstanding and grand total

2️⃣ Daily Collections (Financial Report)

grossCollection, batta, posCharges, netCollection

Treat all as Lakhs

No conversion logic

3️⃣ Payment Planning / Expenses

Planned payments are already in Lakhs

Expense totals must be calculated directly

4️⃣ Financial Report Totals

Net Collection – Expenses = Balance (all in Lakhs)

🚫 Explicitly Out of Scope (DO NOT TOUCH)

❌ Bank Balance logic (we will modify later)

❌ UI / HTML / CSS

❌ JSON file structure

❌ Field names

❌ Route names

🛡 Safety Requirements

If a value is missing, default to 0

No runtime crashes

Date handling must remain dd/mm/yyyy

🎯 Expected Outcome

What I enter as 100 must display as 100.00 everywhere

Financial Report values must exactly match input intent

HSD Outstanding, Collections, Expenses all reconcile correctly

Please apply minimal backend-only changes, refactor carefully, and explain briefly what was fixed.
