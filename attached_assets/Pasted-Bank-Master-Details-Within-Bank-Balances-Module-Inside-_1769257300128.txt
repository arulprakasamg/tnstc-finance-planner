Bank Master Details (Within Bank Balances Module)

Inside the Bank Balances module, allow creation and maintenance of bank master details.

Fields:

Account Name (mandatory)

Account Number (mandatory, editable)

Bank Name (mandatory)

Account Type (Operational / Savings / Special)

Rules:

Account Number must be unique

Account Name and Bank Name cannot be empty

Edit option must always be enabled for bank master details

Deletion:

Prevent deletion if:

Any bank balance exists (any date)

Any payment planning exists

Show clear warning message when deletion is blocked.

2️⃣ Position Date (Core Control)

Introduce and enforce Position Date clearly.

Rules:

Default Position Date = Today

User must be able to change Position Date manually

All bank balances are tied to Position Date

3️⃣ Bank Balance Entry (Rolling Balance Behaviour)

Implement rolling bank balance logic:

When a bank balance is entered on a date (e.g. 23-01-2026):

The same balance must automatically carry forward to the next dates

It should continue to display until the balance is explicitly modified

Example:

Balance entered on 23-01-2026

On 24-01-2026 → same balance auto-displayed

Officer modifies balance on 24-01-2026 → new balance applies from that date onward

4️⃣ Bank Balance Modification Rules

Allow bank balance modification on any Position Date.

Rules:

Only one effective balance per bank per Position Date

Balance must not be negative

Modification applies from that date forward

Previous dates remain unchanged

5️⃣ “Last Updated” Date & Time Display

Display Last Updated Date & Time for each bank balance.

Example:

Last updated on: 23-01-2026 18:45

Rules:

Timestamp updates only when balance is modified

Timestamp must remain visible even when balance is carried forward

Purpose:

Daily verification

Audit clarity

Officer confidence

6️⃣ Integration With Other Modules

Bank balances from this module must be the single source of truth for:

Dashboard → Bank Balance card (total + bank-wise)

Payment Planning → available funds validation

HSD payments → fund availability checks

Always use the latest applicable balance as of Position Date.

7️⃣ UI / UX Constraints

Menu name must remain “Bank Balances”

Keep existing screen layout

Show:

Position Date selector

Bank list with balance fields

Last updated timestamp per bank

Do NOT:

Add new menus

Change sidebar

Redesign UI

8️⃣ Data Safety & Audit Readiness

Ensure:

No hard deletion of balances

Historical balances remain viewable

All changes are date-bound and traceable
