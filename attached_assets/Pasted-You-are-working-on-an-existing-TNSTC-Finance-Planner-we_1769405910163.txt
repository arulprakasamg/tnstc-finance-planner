You are working on an existing TNSTC Finance Planner web app.

Problem:
Financial Report → Bank Balances section always shows 0.00
even though Bank Balances are correctly saved and visible in Dashboard.

Important Context:
- Dashboard bank balance card is already correct
- Bank Balances menu saves data correctly
- Financial Report menu is NOT reflecting saved bank balances
- Position Date selector exists in Financial Report
- Data exists for the selected position date

Root Cause (to fix):
Financial Report is NOT fetching bank balances using the same logic as Dashboard.
It is either:
- Calling the wrong API
- Using wrong date field
- Ignoring latest available balance <= position date

Your Task:
FIX ONLY the Financial Report module.

Scope Rules (STRICT):
- Modify ONLY Financial Report page logic (frontend + backend API used by it)
- Do NOT modify Dashboard
- Do NOT modify Bank Balances menu
- Do NOT modify database schema
- Do NOT add new tables
- Do NOT change UI layout or styling

Correct Behaviour Required:
1. When a Position Date is selected in Financial Report:
   - Fetch bank balances where balance_date <= selected position date
   - For each bank, take the LATEST available balance before or on that date

2. Display values in Bank Balances table exactly like Dashboard:
   - SBI – PLATINUM
   - IOB – 5555
   - I.B
   - IOB – 42300
   - IOB – 142300

3. If no balance exists for a bank before that date:
   - Show 0.00

4. Total should be calculated correctly and shown at the bottom.

Technical Instructions:
- Reuse the SAME query logic used in Dashboard bank balance calculation
- If Dashboard uses an API, call that same API from Financial Report
- If Dashboard computes balances server-side, extract and reuse that logic
- Ensure date comparison is correct (no timezone bug)

Verification Steps (must pass):
- Enter bank balances on Bank Balances menu
- Open Financial Report
- Select same or later position date
- Bank balances MUST appear (not zero)

Do not explain.
Just implement the fix cleanly and safely.
